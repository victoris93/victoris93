## Hiya ðŸ‘‹ðŸ§ 

I'm Victoria, a PhD candidate @NeuroanatomyAndConnectivity. I am looking for brain (connectivity) biomarkers of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.
You might find my repos useful if:

* You too are looking for the best predictor(s) for your model and the number of predictor candidates is overwhelming; [this feature testing & selection pipeline might be of help](https://github.com/victoris93/feature-selection-scz). I might at some point make a package out of it. ðŸ¤”
* You need to compute functional connectomes after fMRIprep (time series parcellation, bandpass filtering, etc.), but you don't know where to start. [Check out my post-fmMRIprep preprocessing package for functional connectomes](https://github.com/victoris93/NeuroConn). It's raw, so any feedback is appreciated.ðŸ’¡

ðŸ”­ Currently I am working on contrastive learning applied to brain data.
If you'd like to collaborate, don't hesitate!
